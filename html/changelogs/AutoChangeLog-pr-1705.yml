changes: 
  - tweak: "felinids no longer take double ear damage, just -2 ear protection. No more excuse to rush earmuffs and a helmet"
  - tweak: "flashbangs no longer hardstun everyone on their tile, and deal high deafness and ear damage instead. The flash component confuses instead of stunning, but the bang component is unchanged"
