changes:
  - balance: Lots of traitor item costs rebalanced.
  - balance: Taeclowndo shoes now usable by anyone, but still can only be bought by
      Clown if not discounted.
  - balance: Stimpack now uses Pump-Up instead of Stimulants. This makes you immune
      to damage slowdown, recover 80% faster from stuns/slips/knockdowns and gain
      80 stamina regen. Also makes you jitter quite a bit.
  - balance: Player minimum requirement for No-Slips removed.
  - balance: Contract Kit has it's set of random items tweaked.
  - balance: Syndi-Kit Special "Bond" kit gets a diversity of magazines and a syndi
      encryption key.
